* Exercise_1 - Write a shell script that prints “Shell Scripting is Fun!” on the screen 

Here instead of direct "echo" I have used cat to show output from a file. 
* Exercise_2 - Modify the shell script from exercise 1 to include a variable. The variable will hold the contents of the message “Shell Scripting is Fun!”  

From Last execise, I have taken content o a variable to show the output.
* Exercise_3 - Store the output of the command “hostname” in a variable. Display “This script is running on _.” where “_” is the output of the “hostname” command.  * Exercise_4 - Write a shell script that displays “man”,”bear”,”pig”,”dog”,”cat”,and “sheep” on the screen with each appearing on a separate line. Try to do this in as few lines as possible.  
* Exercise_5 - Write a shell script that displays, “This script will exit with 0 exit status.” Be sure that the script does indeed exit with a 0 exit status.
* Exercise_6 - Write a shell script that consists of a function that displays the number of files in the present working directory. Name this function “file_count” and call it in your script. If you use variable in your function, remember to make it a local variable.
